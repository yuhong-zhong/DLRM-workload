# The script does the setup to run the benchmarks in the ISCA 2023 paper:
# Optimizing CPU Performance for Recommendation Systems At-Scale.

# Print instructions to be executed before proceeding to part 2. In particular:
# (1) For `conda init` to take effect, the shell must be closed and reopened.
# (2) `conda activate` is meant to be run in an interactive shell, and might not
#     work properly in a shell script.
