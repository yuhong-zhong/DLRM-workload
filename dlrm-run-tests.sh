#   dlrm = ipex.optimize(dlrm, dtype=torch.float, inplace=True, auto_kernel_selection=True)
#
# to:
#
#   dlrm = ipex.optimize(dlrm, dtype=torch.float, inplace=True) # auto_kernel_selection=True)

# This change is needed to prevent the following error:

# Based on the IPEX documentation at

# auto kernel selection is a feature that enables users to tune for better
# performance. So turning it off should not affect any functionality.
